Title: Anti-Money Laundering Detection System

Description:
This project implements a machine learning-based system to detect money laundering activities in financial transactions. The system uses Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models to analyze a large dataset and identify suspicious transactions.

System Requirements:
- Minimum 16 GB RAM

Software Requirements:
- Jupyter Notebook

Setup Instructions:
1. Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements specified above.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if it is not already installed. It can be installed as part of the Anaconda distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

Project Configuration:
1. Download the dataset "LI-Medium_Trans.csv".
2. Place the dataset in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook project files. Ensure that both the dataset and the notebook files are in the same path.

Running the Project:
1. Open Jupyter Notebook.
2. Navigate to the directory where the project files and dataset are located.
3. Open the project notebook file.
4. Execute each cell sequentially:
   - The first cells involve loading and cleaning the data.
   - Subsequent cells include exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
   - Note: Running the model training cells will take a considerable amount of time due to the size of the dataset.

Additional Notes:
- Due to the large size of the dataset, some operations, especially model training, can be very time-consuming.
- Ensure all cells are run in sequence to avoid runtime errors and ensure all dependencies in the code are met.
